The C++ driver builds on x86 and x86-64 architectures for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, FreeBSD and Solaris.

The MongoDB C++ driver library includes a bson package that implements the BSON specification (see http://www.bsonspec.org). This library can be used standalone for object serialization and deserialization even when one is not using MongoDB at all.
