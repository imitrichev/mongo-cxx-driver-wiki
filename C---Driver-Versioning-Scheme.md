## API Versioning                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).                                                                                                                                                               
* bsoncxx and mongocxx both define corresponding CMake variables for MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
## ABI Versioning                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* Both bsoncxx and mongocxx both have a single scalar ABI version.                                                                                                                                                
* Only bump ABI version on **incompatible** ABI change (not for ABI additions).                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
## Parallel Header Installation                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* For mongocxx, install all headers to `$PREFIX/mongocxx/v$MAJOR.$MINOR/`.                                                                                                                                        
* For bsoncxx, install all headers to `$PREFIX/bsoncxx/v$MAJOR.$MINOR/`.                                                                                                                                          
* We install a pkg-config file to shield consumers from this complexity.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
## Sonames and symlinks                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
*Note that below examples are given for libmongocxx, but also apply to libbsoncxx*                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
*DSO = Dynamic Shared Object, to use Ulrich Drepper's terminology*                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* Physical filename for a DSO is `libmongocxx.so.$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH`                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Note that the physical filename is disconnected from ABI version/soname. This looks a bit strange, but allows multiple versions of the library with the same ABI version to be installed on the same system.      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* soname for a DSO is `libmongocxx.$ABI`                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
We provide a soname symlink that links to the physical DSO.                                                                                                                                                       
We also provide a dev symlink that links to the soname symlink of the highest ABI version of the library installed.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
## Inline namespaces                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
* We provide inline namespace macros for both mongocxx and bsoncxx.                                                                                                                                               
* This allows multiple, ABI incompatible versions of the library to be linked into the same application.                                                                                                          
* The name of the namespace is `v$ABI`. We create them from ABI version to maintain forwards compatibibility.
